# SRS Template

A Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document may be a critical
component in the life cycle of an application. The IEEE provides a useful
template which describes what content should be included within the
SRS document. However, as with many SRS templates, there is a lack of
consideration for supporting sections and professional formatting.
Supporting sections may include a table of contents, appendices, figures,
glossary, revision history, acknowledgement, and legal notices. Formatting
of many SRS documents are readable back lack an essence of professionalism.
Our SRS template aims to tackle these issues by providing a complete template
for organizations that contains additional sections to improve the readability
of the document, especially for readers that are not a member of a software field
or lack a technical background.
